UserHold is a motion based verification app that provides an alternative method of verification. By setting a gesture motion,
the app learns to recognize your motion and distinguish it from other motions (and other people performing the same motion).
No machine learning is used throughout the process, making the verification algorithm extremely efficient.

The app currently has two modes: developer mode and test mode. Developer mode allows for rapid collection of accelerometer and
gyroscope data for manual data anlysis. Test mode allows for evaluation of the algorithm as a prototype app.
